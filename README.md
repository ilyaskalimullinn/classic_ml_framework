# Classic Machine Learning models

This repository contains some of my implementations of classic ML models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Gradient Boosting, etc. You can say that this is a basic mini-framework. Nothing too fancy, for the most part it's just an exercise to make sure that I understand everything correctly.

These is mainly a compilation of my homework in KFU ITIS. I improved some of it, added something new. I also didn't include some stuff like AdaBoost. Maybe later! In any case, you can find repositories with my original homework in my GitHub.

## How to check it out

- First of all, I have created a bunch of notebooks. They are not too informative, but I show that my models work and compare them to models from Scikit-Learn.
- If you are using Anaconda, you can run these notebooks yourself! All the necessary requirements are already satisfied.
- I have also created requirements.txt in case you don't have a proper environment installed
